## The problem

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/wejendorp/tradeshift-scripts.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Creating new tradeshift npm libraries requires a lot of boilerplate
configuration, and is prone to errors. Configurations will often diverge or
never be updated.

## This solution

This is a CLI that abstracts away all configuration for open source projects for
linting, testing, building, and more.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev tradeshift-scripts
```

> Note: for now, you'll have to include an `.eslintignore` in your project until
> [this eslint issue is resolved](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9227).

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `tradeshift-scripts`.

This project actually dogfoods itself. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll
find scripts with `node src {scriptName}`. This serves as an example of some of
the things you can do with `tradeshift-scripts`.

To use the `after-success` hooks and automatic [semantic
release][semantic-release], you need to set up your build env with `GH_TOKEN`
and `NPM_TOKEN`.

If you want to automatically publish coverage reports to [codecov][codecov], add
a `CODECOV_TOKEN`.

### Overriding Config

Unlike `react-scripts`, `tradeshift-scripts` allows you to specify your own
configuration for things and have that plug directly into the way things work
with `tradeshift-scripts`. There are various ways that it works, but basically
if you want to have your own config for something, just add the configuration
and `tradeshift-scripts` will use that instead of it's own internal config. In
addition, `tradeshift-scripts` exposes its configuration so you can use it and
override only the parts of the config you need to.

This can be a very helpful way to make _editor integration_ work for tools like
ESLint which require project-based ESLint configuration to be present to work.

So, if we were to do this for ESLint, you could create an `.eslintrc` with the
contents of:

```
{"extends": "./node_modules/tradeshift-scripts/eslint.js"}
```

Or, for `babel`, a `.babelrc` with:

```
{"presets": ["tradeshift-scripts/babel"]}
```

Or, for `jest`:

```javascript
const { jest: jestConfig } = require('tradeshift-scripts/config');
module.exports = Object.assign(jestConfig, {
	// your overrides here
});
```

> Note: `tradeshift-scripts` intentionally does not merge things for you when
> you start configuring things to make it less magical and more straightforward.
> Extending can take place on your terms. I think this is actually a great way
> to do this.

## Inspiration

This is inspired by `react-scripts`.

## Other Solutions

`tradeshift-scripts` is a fork of [kcd-scripts][kcd], adapted to tradeshift.
